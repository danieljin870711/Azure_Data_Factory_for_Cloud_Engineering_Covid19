# Azure Data Factory for Cloud Engineering

As we approach a modern data warehouse over an on-prem server, it is critical to understand how to implement a robust cloud data warehouse. One of the key areas within cloud warehousing is to have proper data pipelines. This is how the data can be extracted, transformed, and loaded into the data warehouse. In this project, I will demonstrate how to build data pipelines with Azure Data Factory (ADF) for data ingestion, data transformation, data load, and data orchestration for advanced business intelligence analytics. 

## Project Covers... 
- Azure Environment Setup
- Data Ingestion from Azure Blob
- Data Ingestion from HTTP
- Data Flows
- Copy Data to Azure SQL DB
- Data Orchestration
